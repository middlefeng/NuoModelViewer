# Nuo Model Viewer

This project consists of:
* A Wavefront OBJ viewer, supporting both real-time rendering and ray-tracing, which is based on Viewer Foundation, a reusable framework.
* Viewer Foundation, a reusable framework consisting of:
  * Viewer Foundation Render, which is an encapsulation to the Metal APIs, providing simplified resource and state management on top of the Metal APIs.
  * A scene-graph-like system which enables building real-time and path-tracing based renderers.

## Supported GPUs

* Apple Silicon GPU is supposed to be the only GPU working on macOS in the future.
  * M1 Max.

⚠️❗The whole Intel Mac product line has been terminated. AMD eGPU support is obsoleted.
> * Intel HD serious GPUs are **not** supported. (Built-in integrated GPU in most models of Mac.)
> * AMD Radeon Pro 560, and built-in descrete GPUs in almost all MacBook Pro later than 2017, are barely suppored. Their performance would be poor for the ray tracing rendering.
> * For early macOS on Intel supporting eGPU, AMD Radeon RX 580 or above is recommended, in particular but not limited to:
>   * AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 is recommended.
>   * AMD Radeon RX Vega 64, RX 5700, and so on, should be working, but untested.
>   * AMD Radeon VII is highly recommended.
>   * AMD Radeon Pro Vega II (Duo) (in the Mac Pro 2019). [1]
>   * AMD Radeon Pro W5700. [1]
> 
>  [1] Acknowledge to @ibuick for the verification.

</p>

* Hybrid rendering with ray tracing.
  * Direct lighting soft shadow.
  * Indirect lighting (ambient) with physically-based occlusion.
  * Physically based effect for the shadow overlay (blend-in with photographic scene).
  * Self-illuminating objects.
* Checkerboard background for better inspecting the result transparency.

* Transformation on the entire scene accurately around the scene's center.
* More accurate bounds calculation (improving shadow map sampling quality).
* User selection on GPU.
* Better take advantage of dedicated video memory by using private buffers. Especially important for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BflXSN7BsUY/">desktop-class graphics card or external GPU</a>).
* Background loading.
* Motion blur.
* Blending with real-scene background.
